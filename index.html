        <h1>About India</h1>
        <div>
            <p>India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in South Asia. It is
                the
                seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in
                the
                world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal
                on
                the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the
                north;
                and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and
                the
                Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.

        <div>
            <p>
                London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just over
                9 million.[9] It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km)
                estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[10] The City of
                London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains
                boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][11] Since the 19th century,[12] the name "London" has
                also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex,
                Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13] which largely comprises Greater London,[14] governed by the
                Greater London Authority.

            <p>
                Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the capital of the Emirate of
                Dubai.[3][4][5] Established in the 18th century as a small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the
                early 21st century with a focus on tourism and hospitality,[6] having the second most five-star hotels
                in the world,[7] and the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.[8]

                In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Arabian Gulf,[9] it is also a major global
                transport hub for passengers and cargo.[10] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city,
                which was already a major mercantile hub. A centre for regional and international trade since the early
                20th century, Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and
                financial services

                New Zealand is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It
                consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te
                Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area, covering
                268,021 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi). New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of
                Australia across the Tasman Sea and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the islands of New Caledonia,
                Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps,
                owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its
                most populous city is Auckland
